1	Hollywood's definitive depiction of the 1960s American civil rights movement - as well as perhaps the most timely movie you'll see this year.
1	For all its grand, overblown designs, there are some genuinely engaging surprises. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen are a riot.
1	The entire performance is one of the greatest in Hanks' prolific, varied career - a role that gives him a massive arc and the opportunity to show great range.
1	An almost indescribable pleasure from Brooklyn-based cartoonist and animator Nina Paley. The film, dazzling and poignant and five years in the making, retells the ancient Indian epic The Ramayana from a gentle but insistent feminist perspective.
1	I'll give Blade: Trinity the benefit of the doubt and assume the movie is meant to be high camp of the lowest order.
1	If Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter takes its time, it's time worth taking.
1	Violent tale with themes of addiction and domestic abuse.
1	Miami Connection is one of those rare films where the positive energy exuded by its oh-so-amateur cast and crew starts to rub off on you, despite the fact that almost all of the basic tenets of motion-picture storytelling are non-existent.
1	Add to that a spectacular celebrity-studded finale and you have a very successful, if not quite as original, follow up to one of the funniest films of this century.
1	Demonstrating his enduring ability to entertain while embracing the latest technology and remaining relevant to a modern audience, Spielberg proves he's still Hollywood's number one player.

1	It's a brutal, dark, all-too-probable thriller that effectively does every genre thing you'd expect.

1	Very much in the style of Roald Dahl, this is a decent kids movie with witty, wall-to-wall sight and sound gags.
1	Even if certain elements of the movie seemed familiar individually, the whole of the enterprise feels different. It's a different voice and approach, and different is good.
1	...producer David O. Selznick's crowning achievement and a film that stands up as one of the screen's finest classics.
1	It's a movie that makes you think -- if not outright say -- You're a good guy. You don't have to do something this stupid. Oh, now look what you've gone and done.
1	Pain & Glory is another victory for the auteur Pedro Almodovar and sees Antonio Banderas deliver a career-best performance as an ageing artist undergoing an existential crisis.
1	Despite all its pain, love is always worth it, the film argues-and makes you believe.
1	The city looks good enough to dive into. If only the humans in the frame weren't so shallow.
1	As an action film, it's irreproachable -- just don't expect it to mean anything.
1	Enjoyable slacker comedy with likeable characters, a steady stream of decent gags and strong performances from a superb comic cast...
1	Director Justin Lin has a spooky, second sense for staging bombastic action sequences, even if he breaks every law in physics to make them work.
1	A virulent, heart-shattering Korean revenge opus that deals out Promethean punishment to its central character.
1	Snake Eyes so quickly disintegrates into formula, and the characters into caricatures, that it completely loses steam by the halfway mark.
1	Hoover has been portrayed for so long by the Left as a monster that it's refreshing to see Eastwood illuminate his achievements...
1	The Green Inferno sets out to be simply entertaining, and is.
1	Both Auteuil and Binoche superbly craft world-weary characters who feel alienated and objectified. The pathos seeps through the screen.
1	A little more Thumbelina spunkiness would have gone a long way toward making this a more compelling story for kids - and especially for grown-ups.
1	What you take home are memorable, amusing moments of three truly adventurous amigos we've all grown up with.
1	A harrowing and inspiring tale of courage and endurance. It shows us the best in ourselves.
1	I totally loved this movie. My group was aged 28-33, and we laughed, roared, bust a gut laughing, the whole movie.
1	By creating a mystery rooted in more psychological terrors than supernatural ones they create a good atmosphere and some legitimately functional scares. [Full Review in Spanish]
1	It's a touch bloated, but it just might be the most enjoyable Pirates of the Caribbean movie since the first one. (Yes, I said Pirates of the Caribbean.)
1	It is simply content to stand next to its ilk, doing exactly what they already did, unwilling to defend its existence past indulging one of filmmaking's most indulgent filmmakers.
1	[Keeps] the viewer entertained with a mix of suspense and humor, but not exactly 'date night' material, because it's doubtful anyone will be having sex right after seeing it.
1	A curious concoction of blood, beer, babes and biker ghosts.
1	Borrowing heavily from John Hughes movies, the witty script ensures that the film succeeds as both high school movie and superhero adventure.
1	Since Precious bears such an unpalatable, relentlessly-bleak-to-the-point-of-clich√© ghetto premise (see: Tyler Perry), its effectiveness as a film hinges on the quality of the performances
1	A Grand Slam
1	It's Back to the Beach writ saucy.
1	Khan Chittenden and Mo Yzu-Yi are effective enough within the limitations placed on their characters

1	'The Gentlemen' is a top-notch entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish]
1	Engaging, emotional and just a very good movie.

1	A scrappy simulation of American idealism personified by the willingness, nay, the need, to be the first to volunteer whenever the mission requires a sacrifice for the greater good.
1	Thoroughly modern remake of 1978 B-movie classic is surprisingly smart and delivers zombie-tastic action-horror thrills.
1	Involving story about a college graduate trying to make her way in the world while living at home as a full-fledged member of the 'Boomerang Generation."
1	Despite the scenes featuring Moffitt and Tenzing were sometimes awkward and the inclusion of 3D not adding much to the overall viewing experience, Beyond The Edge is an enjoyable, informative and sometime-stunning docu-film.
1	Enormous fun from beginning to end. Here's hoping we don't have to wait too long for Part 2.
1	Beatty, Christie and Altman make an unbeatable combination.
1	This second effort is even better than the first go around.
1	Meet Lily and Jarrod, the latest pair of awkward, fumbling outcasts to be struck by Cupid's off-kilter arrow.

1	Slow and steady, sure-handed and gripping.
1	Renders a poignant - yet enlightening story behind Fred Rogers. it's high on my list as one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Bring Kleenex
1	A satisfying police yarn with some really great, physically hefty location photography.
1	[I]t's an exhilarating, absolute joy to watch it all come together.
1	Like the earlier Huston/Tolstoy projects, Two Jacks is cheap-looking and rough around the edges, but there's a confidence about all these films too.
1	One of the greatest of all films.
1	Scott Z Burns's clever screenplay takes a satirical swipe at a yuppie culture in which everyone seems to be on medication. But then it starts working on gripping, more sinister levels.
1	Directed by Amma Asante (who helmed Belle with a similarly sure and light touch) A United Kingdom is a powerful story told with grace, dignity and restraint.
1	Simply a masterful adap of Tennessee Williams' sultry, searing play and an affirmation of Marlon Brando's acting genius.
1	The outcome is gory and glorious.
1	The LEGO Movie 2 won't have to sweat bricks in order to amuse audiences of all ages, but the older ones will probably be disappointed in this film's not so awesome tendency to follow instructions.
1	For Your Consideration is not the best film put out by the Christopher Guest rep company. But it might be the funniest.
1	Hostel has style, and it has its moments, but overall it's a mixed (barf) bag.
1	Evan Cecil knows what he is doing here.

1	A gripping psychological thriller that, while lacking the power of Funny Games, is still the work of a master.
1	It's smart enough to really cut loose and relaxed enough to be funny.
1	This film is best taken as a visual ode to an all-but-forgotten way of life.
1	[Swanberg] points the movie in directions that defy our expectations, exploring the characters' immaturity and the entropy of human interaction.
1	A step-by-step instruction video I fear might inadvertently influence some impressionable young minds to try an ill-advised line of work that will only land them in a lot of trouble.
1	Set in the comfortable upper middle-class neighbourhood of Roma in Mexico City, this compelling story centres on a marriage slowly splintering apart and the native Latina live-in maid who stands at the swirling heart of the family for whom she works.

1	It works thrillingly for audiences, especially the pointy-headed kind who have been trained to predict the outcomes of every week's slasher.
1	The script is unevenly polished and slightly disjointed.
1	Hooper successfully welds together the terrifying steel of Leatherface's chainsaw with a good dose of backwoods Texas humour.
1	One of the most original and clever little comedies I've really ever seen, and it's all due to the greatness that is the Coen Brothers.
1	The film is constructed with meticulously composed shots that emphasise in subtle ways how life can be confined by political instability, and Suleiman uses black comedy to dissect the absurdities of the situation.
1	Una tremenda experiencia sensorial, una cinta que dejar√° maravillados a los fans del libro, y a quienes, virginalmente, se enfrenten por vez primera a los toques arom√°ticos de esta m√°gica historia.

1	One of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies.
1	An unusually immersive filmgoing experience, no 3-D effects necessary.
1	As politically savvy as it is raucous and funny, Barbershop: The Next Cut is a stylish cut above its predecessors.
1	That's not to say the whole isn't still extremely entertaining with their wealth of humor and priceless anecdotes. It simply never quite delivers what it appears to sell.
1	It could stand to have as much clarity afforded to its narrative and thematics as to its visuals.
1	The movie smartly evokes the yearnings and insecurities of a young man gradually growing into his own skin.
1	Beautifully scripted and acted under the sublime direction of Tamara Jenkins.
1	Crowe is still a master navigator of swampy territory, and any movie that can warm the heart and tickle the funny bone without selling its soul is to be cherished, warts and all.
1	Dudley's drunk act wears thin quickly, but Liza is adorable and Sir John is perfection.
1	A powerful, darkly skewed coming-of-age film that peerlessly makes use of its obscure setting and striking authenticity.
1	Shocks and awakens its audience in all the right ways, bringing the recent headlines of a Columbia University rape survivor carrying her mattress around into sharp focus.
1	"Fury's" pace is delirious, the stunts are incredible - such crashes, such explosions, such a lot of flying bodies - Hardy's performance is a marvel of subdued conviction and Theron brings an impressive gravity to her work as Furiosa.
1	it's the closest we're gonna get to the golden age when Mel Blanc did the voices and the cartoons were directed by Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson
1	The movie is pretty good.
1	Although Depp has little range, he's acceptable in the lead - a source of calm and emotional steadiness, which contrasts the nervousness and paranoia of his associates.
1	Lee Evans steals every scene he's in.
1	A slavish, supercharged riff on Sergio Leone's epic three-the-hard-way spaghetti Western, Kim Ji-woon's all-star spectacle wastes little time in lighting a fire under its unholy trinity's derrieres.
1	It begins slowly, but when it gets going, it rings a series of amusing, if not entirely unpredictable, changes on the theme 'what if you went back in time and changed things?'
1	Spearheaded by Michael Fassbender's mesmerising lead performance, this tragic tale grips your senses from the beginning and never lets go.
1	The Place Beyond the Pines is ambitious and epic, perhaps to a fault.
1	A sobering documentary focusing on Mariel Hemingway and her struggle with the terrible curse of seven suicides in her family history.
1	Despite its grim substance, a crowd-pleaser of the traditional school.
1	[Cutler] worms his way into subcultures without judgment or probing, preferring to let group dynamics speak for themselves.
1	A lonely young man falls head over keyboard in love with his computer's operating system...It's not just any operating system, but one designed to be empathetic with humans, and has Scarlett Johansson as its Siri-with-sex-appeal voice. Who could resist?
1	Transformers is long and loud and should not be ... compared with some dramatic work. Just let it stand on its own and transform you into a kid for a couple-+ hours.
1	It takes a while for the film to start being bad.
1	It's not a stretch to say these penguins experience recognizable emotions such as grief, jealousy, pride and plain old romance. Who knew?
1	Breezy fun that sticks a shiv into Hollywood's - and the larger culture's - disdain for women. Wonderfully subtle comic performances from a great cast having a ball make for a perfectly suitable light diversion from the world right now.
1	Where things shine is the trickiness in exploring the politics of this cult.
1	There is no doubt about it - Amy Adams is the sole reason Walt Disney Pictures' "Enchanted" is so, well, enchanting.
1	The audience at my screening cheered the most loudly when Stan Lee, Ferrigno and characters from other Marvel titles appeared for their cameos. If the movie had worked a little better on its own, the Hulk would have gotten more applause just for himself.
1	I walked out with songs on my lips and a stitch in my side from laughing so hard.
1	A pleasant diversion full of sun, music and beautiful girls.
1	A skilful and continually surprising drama, Tokyo Sonata depicts the gradual deterioration of an ordinary Japanese family after its breadwinner loses his job owing to corporate downsizing.
1	[Greta] Gerwig manages to narrate a common experience without falling into the clich√©s of Hollywood. [Full Review in Spanish]
1	Leguizamo's storytelling, while conventional, features lively interactions, embraceable characters and credibly depicted struggles. The tournament scenes contain sports-movie adrenaline.
1	[Patriots Day] emphasises the heroism of a city full of individuals, united by tragedy and resilience.
1	Though all aspects of the film are excellent from story to cinematography to directing it is the acting which holds the whole thing together. The three leads are amazing.
1	Wildlife features some truly wonderful actors plying their craft at the highest of levels. And I didn't believe a one of them for a cold minute.
1	A fascinating airing of dirty laundry leading to an overdue reconciliation between a browbeaten daughter and her merciless abuser.
1	Fans of great 1960s rock and roll will love the incredible 40 song soundtrack but little else.
1	A powerful, artistic expression of one of the most pivotal moments in the Christian religion.
1	Romero and King have approached this movie with humor and affection, as well as with an appreciation of the macabre.
1	Hoss is mesmerizing as a woman who holds it all together to the point of losing herself.
1	It is a perfectly good piffle of a film.
1	A tight, solid mystery/thriller that keeps you guessing until the end.
1	Delicately balances the inherent drama of the tragic circumstances with the comedy of manners that is the Royal Family's dysfunction, and Britain's ambivalent attitudes to the same.
1	It's an achievement to make 3D look as good as it does here, but that counts for little if the characters are all in 1D. The film is a triumph of effects over affect.
1	This sparkling Cinderella tale provides the additional kick of watching the glass slipper crack through the glass ceiling.
1	a nice place to get lost for a few hours.
1	There are some wildly funny scenes, a few leaden ones and others that are scattershot, with humorous satire undercut by over-the-top grisliness. Still, when it's funny, it's really funny.
1	Everything that works in Nocturnal Animals is intoxicating, provocative, delicious - and happily, so is everything that doesn't.
1	From their inspired pairing on Saturday Night Live and their hysterical 2008 comedy Baby Mama to their riotous hosting of the Golden Globes, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are one of the funniest double-acts in recent memory.
1	The gags take precedence over the perfunctory plot, and the overarching theme about Gru and his girls' search for a mother figure is too undercooked.
1	The most amazing thing about Will Ferrell is that he can make absolutely nothing funny.
1	Cartoonish and absurd, "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" is the film that fans demanded but not the one the franchise deserves.
1	"Neighbors" is not the classic raunchy comedy it wants to be, but it certainly isn't for lack of trying.
1	This is the best bad movie you will see all year.
1	It doesn't fight shy of a truly frightening final twist, which makes it not only bleaker but also more truthful than virtually every other movie in this genre, which all too often is over-populated and under-humanised.
1	Irresistible is one of the dullest, most toothless comedies in recent memory.
1	Spotlight appears to tick all the boxes as far as the true-life awards-season investigation drama goes... It makes a few choices you aren't expecting, though, and I can't figure out whether or not this elevates it.
1	Surprise hovers over this dry-roasted and altogether compelling Irish comedy-drama like a creature waiting to stun the cast of the movie into submission.
1	A tender enough tearjerker to dehydrate even this crabby curmudgeon!
1	A bold indictment of capitalism, consumerism, and cultural appropriation
1	witnessing Malick's vision of eternal life obliterated me almost immediately
1	When it takes to the skies Amelia really soars with thrilling recreations of Earhart's solo flights but when it returns to earth all that remains is soap opera.
1	This indie gem marks the arrival of Oscar season. McAnulty and Mackay give very natural performances that are real and genuine.
1	In a time when, more often than not, sequels disappoint, it's refreshing to uncover something this high-profile that fulfils the promise of its name and adds another title to a storied legacy.
1	Like a symphony where every note is exactly where it needs to be, or a painting without a brushstroke wasted, The Dark Knight is an unabashed, unashamedly great film.
1	made my jaw drop as I realized I was in for something special
1	This might be the last time for another several features that Bond actually feels like a secret agent.
1	When at its best, it's easy to understand its cult status.
1	Spurlock proves himself a supersize talent; he makes you choke on every laugh.
1	Like an amalgam of every "ABC After-School Special" ever made ... makes most Lifetime Channel movies seem competent by comparison.
1	Tom Cruise is the American Jackie Chan at this point. He's doing his own stunts for the love of the game.
1	The movie doesn't nail its attempts to depict how hobbits and wizards and elves were born from Tolkien's youth, but it does create an appealing portrait of a brainy misfit.
1	I wouldn't go so far as to call the product fine wine, but a little extra aging seems to have done it no harm. So watcha gonna do?
1	[Blue Car contains] a fantastic (and most likely star-making) performance by Agnes Bruckner and a script that never strikes a false or phony note.
1	Michael Bay has made three Transformers movies, and he hasn't done one yet that was as much fun as this.
1	My first thought was teenagers with super powers - not again! But somehow the script, the actors and the special effects made it something worth watching.
1	Charade is able to successfully transcend the romance, comedy, and suspense thriller genres because of the cast, screenplay, and score.
1	Anita O'Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer chooses from all the existing materials, and is invaluable.
1	For a franchise so insistent on its freshness, its villain looks awfully old-fashioned.
1	It may not boldly go where no "Star Trek" film has gone before, but it gets there at warp speed, and with a full tank of fresh ideas.
1	Saying this movie is about boxing is akin to saying Citizen Kane is about a sled.
1	Harpoon proves that originality isn't dead yet. Strap in for a tense fun-filled ninety minutes or so aboard a ship of mistrust, deception and intrigue. Prepare to wince and smirk in equal measure and above all heed the warnings.
1	To say that Munich is the most important film released this year is putting it mildly. To say that it's the best is being generous.
1	Seemingly off-hand, cumulatively imposing, utterly masterful.
1	Apart from its fantastic elements, Woody's script of Sam finds a deft blend of the comic and romantic.
1	Loosely - "very loosely," according to Yang - based on the life of the director's own father, Tigertail is a tight and deeply felt meditation on memory and responsibility.
1	A gripping, deeply affecting experience delivered with no Hollywood hooey but an appreciation of small lives and human foibles.
1	Canny Native American bite at the zombie genre with impressive brutality
1	For the most part, "The Painter and the Thief" seems authentic, a very real portrait of two unique individuals. It not only explores the artistic impulse, but also issues of relationships, addiction and rehab.
1	The story is so good-naturedly silly that while not exactly challenging, it should keep even the grown-ups at least smiling.
1	"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" is a sensitive balancing act between wit and the drama of war without ever branching into anything overly political and staying in the realm of its comfort, which is its journalism aspect.
1	Ferrell's ideally suited to man-boy characters, and that's what Phil Weston is.
1	It's a movie that fleshes out the people who entertain us, not with bemusement like a Christopher Guest mockumentary, but with compassion.
1	Dawn of the Dead is ultra-violent, excessively bloody, and extremely gory - all in a good way. I left the theater feeling pumped full of adrenaline.
1	The Express is involving and inspiring in the way a good movie about sports almost always is.
1	Mr. Doueiri's film sheds light on Lebanon's wonderfully different court procedures, which allow all sorts of cross-talk, incendiary speeches and interruptive plaintiff-defendant involvement.
1	Things are just as bleak at the end as they began, driving home the point that citizens, absolutely women, have every right in the world for wanting to seek refuge in more hospitable, progressive, developed, countries
1	[Herzog] simply means to show us things as they are - and in this corner of Texas, just north of Houston, things are undeniably violent. And mean.
1	Think of it as a can of Coke. You open it, it's fizzy and delightful. If you ponder the ingredients in any depth, you're just going to gross yourself out. And if you leave it open for awhile, it's going to go flat. So drink up and don't think too much.
1	...Tolstoy seems half-monk and half-clown, a seeming contradiction translated with extraordinary clarity by Plummer.
1	The resolution ties up enough loose ends to be satisfying, yet makes you think long after you've left the theater.
1	Visually, "Coraline" rests between Terry Gilliam's rudimentary "Monty Python" work and Pixar's prestigious polish. Every background is beautiful in a children's film that's mesmerizing and a bit bothersome at times, just as it should be.
1	M. Night Shyamalan has returned to the quality of his most celebrated films, offering a very entertaining movie with a good direction. [Full review in Spanish]
1	Kate McKinnon steals the film with her joyously kooky, radiantly charismatic turn.
1	Though chunks of the novel are missing, the film is, for the most part, a creatively and metaphorically successful synthesis of Dick's dreamlike themes and real-world concerns.
1	Surf's Up is that rarity in a children's movie, a comedy that's actually exciting. Watching the penguins ride inside the tube of a wave, or plunge under the surface, you may find yourself wanting to cheer.
1	A mind-bending masterpiece that's a must for more cerebral fans of the time-travel genre.
1	The Master is built around two towering, career-high feats of acting.
1	Roger Stone is quick, clever, and has survived through so scandal that you can't help but admire him...and hate him. It doesn't really matter what I think. Roger Stone doesn't care. But watching the documentary is a necessary evil worth undertaking.
0	Brutal horror movie offers little to reflect on.
0	Larran keeps the action tightly focused on his small cast, closing in on a claustrophobic, macabre ending that works as a neat summary of all the deprivation and cruelty that has led up to it.
0	The Good Shepherd leaves you longing for the other, better political thrillers it evokes.
0	A Guinevere, and an Arthur myth, for our times, if not for the ages.
0	The script, co-written by Rose with director Robert Cary, is flatfooted in the extreme, lacking any comic value or real human insight.
0	While political and social context is kept to a minimum, the darkly poetic images they capture speak volumes about what the miners go through.
0	A Monster Calls joins a rich trove of movies in which children process real-life ordeals by escaping into elaborate fantasies, which doesn't make director J.A. Bayona's film any less beautiful or haunting.
0	It's wildly predictable and a little cheesy. And yet, it's an absolute gem of a movie.
0	After finally watching this ruthlessly constructed, exquisitely vicious depiction of all-out gender warfare, I would say that, yes, Gone Girl is anti-female. It's also anti-male. Hell, it's anti-human. That's where the fun comes in.
0	But small lapses, together with the confusions and glib evasions of a production that is neither fact nor fiction, raise the larger question of what the film is, and ultimately becomes.
0	Julius Avery wrote and directed with an eye toward a fast pace and grim atmospherics.
0	The thing is so darn retro, so darn, well, That Darn Cat, that it has a peculiar appeal.
0	moiazei me mikser poy o kathenas petakse mesa tin idea toy me ligo seloteip gia na kollisei
0	Not a Lively fan? You won't last five minutes. In it for the action? I give you 30 minutes. Enjoy looking at Johnson and Kitsch? You might make it to the midpoint.
0	Mouret is the cinematic offspring of Woody Allen and Eric Rohmer. From the former he takes the actor-director presenting himself as neurotic but satisfying lover; from the latter he absorbs the pleasure of extended talk. Mouret's talk is enjoyable, but i
0	Even a sharp pace can't disguise the lack of dramatic momentum.
0	Self-serving and juvenile.
0	Its heroes may be old, but the film feels delightfully fresh.
0	Not the worst horror movie right now, but it's certainly the worst film of the trilogy. [Full review in Spanish]
0	With a subject seemingly so amenable to heartless derision, the film is remarkable for its warmth and generosity and conviviality.
0	Invisible friends, evil spirits and strange occurrences form part of the threads of this acclaimed %u2026 stylish and subtle film whose imagery lingers
0	It's a crime that one of the most fascinating stories of ancient literature could be turned into such a dull film.
0	Despite its flaws, Pope Francis is filled with moments that bring the pontiff and his message to life.

0	An assemblage of almost-characters in an almost-story, resulting in a very disappointing almost-movie.
0	Raymond Chandler's sentimental foolishness is the taking-off place for Robert Altman's heady, whirling sideshow of a movie, set in the early-seventies L.A. of the stoned sensibility.
0	Something that is both beautiful (Michael Ballhaus' cinematography is exquisite) and bizarre -- a screwball comedy where Prince and Benton gleefully ham it up for the camera.
0	How did 3 Days to Kill, which doesn't have the worst imaginable premise, turn out this bad?
0	Despite the earnest approach from its two stars (who also serve, with Christopher Smith, as producers), there isn't anything fresh in the story.
0	The movie has the effect of a perfected and unrepeatable gesture.
0	Michael Bay's latest robot flick disappoints, but then again, expectations weren't high.
0	Not only is the movie vile and callous, but also it's pretty darn stupid.
0	Everything has a fusty, embalmed quality: Whatever gave the novel its vitality has been smothered.
0	"Alice Through the Looking Glass" is a movie for anyone who ever skimmed a passage of Lewis Carroll and thought, "This is great, but it could use a bit more 'Terminator.'"
0	As this movie points out, time off is precious, so why waste it watching sub-par silliness?
0	In the rush to make something for everyone, the final product is almost nothing for anyone... Waterworld gave you more bang for the buck...
0	Opaque and formally ungainly, this itchy meditation on a host of contemporary social ills offers audiences a vividly, deliberately ugly worldview, but finally makes for hollow viewing.
0	It's a narrow treatment of a now pressingly relevant subject, but one that still rewards as a powerful, well-acted tale of personal redemption.
0	All Eyez on Me is absolutely awful. It's a collection of scenes showing us events without any tissue connecting the narrative. Nothing here is engaging, which is a shame because it's very clear that Demetrius is giving it his all
0	Sweary, silly, schlocky, satisfyingly surreal [but] as Ben Daimio puts it, "Hellboy does not add up".
0	Knock Knock is a nasty bit of business, and fans of Roth are not likely to be disappointed. But for everyone else, the joke's on them.
0	This world is divided between the makers and the takers, and after just a few minutes of "Red Dawn," you'll realize there's not much more you can take.
0	Parts of the film really stand out, but taken as a whole, it's a labyrinth of conflicting ideas.
0	Completely absorbing from start to finish.
0	The potential of this pure Hollywood Babylon story remains unrealised, instead playing out as half-baked Agatha Christie.
0	Ranks as one of Disney's weakest theatrical releases in years. Woof, indeed.
0	Simultaneously knowing and clueless, the script has the try-hard feel of someone attempting to update the savage teen talk of Heathers, while the plot unfurls as if Scream never happened.
0	The director's Polanski preoccupation borders on imitation. Still, Keating's flattery is sincere, and so is his wish to stylishly freak you silly.
0	[Happy as Lazzaro] flies with poetry over the painful reality of people who practically live in the street, with a character who is all innocence. [Full review in Spanish]
0	Skyfall achieves a new level of motion picture excellence, truly making the trip to the theaters for the latest 007 picture a memorable experience. It's the perfect celebration of 50 years of Bond.
0	The balance of action and humour is off here and by dialing down the moments of ridiculousness from his other films with Ferrell, McKay has made them all the more glaringly odd.
0	The jarring MTV-style filmmaking is so distracting and the 'messaging' so unsubtle that after two long hours you find yourself leaving the theater with a massive headache, wondering when you started to hate Mormons.
0	At times, there's a sense the writers are trying to shoehorn sexual crudity into the plot to hit the young male market, but that feels uncomfortably out of place in a movie about helping children.
0	As a sequel it delivers but this is when everything started going down. [Full review in Spanish].
0	The Dames... are beautiful and lively.
0	Every line is a Big Statement, every character has exactly one defining quality, and every plot development is cornier than the last.
0	The director, Mark Waters, moves things briskly along and lets the charming absurdity of penguin behavior rise to its inherently good-natured heights.
0	I commend [The Shape of Water] for daring to be different. It plays with an old type of story and creates something that is entirely its own.
0	Is the world of the film ruled by its high concept, its low comedy, its demographic credibility, or its romantic screwball realism? Ultimately, Orgy's refusal to be any one thing-including good or bad-forms a kind of epochal statement.
0	There are a few genius gags in Scary Movie 3, but the laugh-to-joke ratio is disappointingly low.
0	It's likely the best anti-Christmas Christmas movie since Bad Santa.
0	This is the movie The Hours should have been. Proof that you can tell a melancholy story with tragic characters, but provide dramatic bite and compelling entertainment.
0	Director Mimi Leder becomes such a manipulatively mawkish emotional puppeteer that it feels as if she's tossing tear gas grenades into the audience.
0	What starts out as a fairly worthy attempt to make a 2001 or Solaris for the new millennium winds up being just another overblown genre film.
0	Its' surreal and funny and at the exact same moments, sickening, verging on horror.
0	... a mediocre biopic that tends to pull its punches
0	If the girls in Ghost World were to see this one, they'd gag.
0	There are great performances by the cast, especially Schreiber who delivers a placid interpretation of constant reflection. [Full review in Spanish]
0	In one of the most generous pieces of movie casting ever, travel writer Bill Bryson is portrayed by Robert Redford in this lazy, feather-light adaptation of his book about walking the Appalachian Trail.
0	A movie that presents and accepts. It doesn't needlessly explain, psychoanalyze its subject, or provide the distance and condescension of an ethnographic survey.
0	Leapin' lizards! The evergreen Broadway musical "Annie'' strays far from its Depression-era roots with truly dismaying results in this crass, charmless, tineared and lead-footed update.
0	Acting and directing are consistently high caliber, but relatively de rigeur for the lot.
0	a plotless, mostly humorless time-killer that exists primarily as a 90-minute commercial for a star-studded soundtrack. ... the movie has all the earmarks of the "let's just make it up as we go along" school of filmmaking.
0	A New York movie as surprising and inventive in showing us the city through the eyes of a runaway boy as Morris Engel's Little Fugitive must have seemed to audiences in 1953.
0	An old-fashioned, screen-filling picture that is at times as rousing and untamed as the continent that it depicts.
0	Even the glossy photography and Pfeiffer's convincing performance can't make this add up to more than its slightly amusing parts.
0	And the crowd roars - why, Natalie, why?
0	Just in time for Thanksgiving: the Paris Hilton movie.
0	Once the group as we originally know it from the movie's story dissolves, so too does the movie's narrative cohesion and, surprisingly, distinctiveness.
0	The material showcases the lead actors' strengths. Downey's is hyper-verbal glibness with a black sheep's injured sadness in his eyes. Duvall's is grizzled authority undercut by the infirmities of age.
0	No one will confuse Hilary Swank with Lucille Ball, but she's entertaining enough to keep this one from becoming a gooey chick flick
0	What elevates Paths of Glory above and beyond the standard war film (despite Kubrick's keen direction) is its final moments.
0	Doesn't offer much in the way of new insights into this most peculiar of subgenres.
0	Suddenly Labor Day is not a movie but a Harlequin book cover, and Frank is a felonious Fabio.
0	A lovely tribute to a man who was a surrogate father to pretty much anyone born in the second half of the 20th century.
0	A near-miss, a film with some funny scenes that will probably work significantly better on DVD, but, ultimately, it quite simply doesn't have enough laughs to elevate it to greatness.
0	In steering the film closer to his own vision, director Adamson steers it away from C.S. Lewis's, and so it loses some of the book's core spiritual themes.
0	This is the worst film I've seen this year.
0	This is another dreary collaboration by husband-wife team Bradley Rust Gray and So Yong Kim, who have no idea what to do with a simple narrative.
0	Its thrills fall with metronome-like precision, exactly when they are expected, and the clues complete the puzzle without surprise or personality.
0	The film is earnestly and unabashedly melodramatic to an extent that may baffle audiences accustomed to clever, knowing historical fictions. But it also has a depth and purity of feeling that makes other movies feel timid and small by comparison.
0	A slickly produced slice of sentimental hokum that borrows freely from a half-dozen or so other, better feel-good fantasies.
0	It's noisy, fast-paced and stuffed with special effects. The screenplay? You've got to be joking!
0	There's never been a better look at high school malcontents
0	...precisely the sort of over-the-top and unapologetically silly endeavor one might've anticipated...
0	Not recommended for claustrophobics. It's more or less a smothering experience.
0	Sex Drive is a Sure Thing for the Superbad generation. But if it lacks much of The Sure Thing's warmth and romance, Sex Drive makes up for that in goofy, no holds-barred raunch.
0	A bittersweet, elegiac tone can't help but suffuse a film animated by so many anarchic spirits who have since left the planet, but it leaves viewers with the exhilarating, inspiring reassurance that we still have Iggy.
0	The style is arresting and the leads are strong, but the story runs out of steam.
0	Never makes the emotional connection needed to turn its protagonist from a hero into a human being.
0	The film is aided immeasurably by Judianna Makovsky's costume design. Clothes are an intentional method of deciphering The Hunger Games' politics.
0	You could put this movie's scenes on shuffle, and it would almost make as much sense.
0	While Girl Model falls a bit short in the delivery of hard facts and incriminating evidence, it more than makes up for that with its knotty psychological profile of Arbaugh.
0	Lives up to its promise of definitiveness...a significant piece of journalism.
0	Hilariously naff science-fiction mularkey that appears to have been cobbled together like Frankenstein's monster from the discarded body parts of Total Recall, The Matrix, Source Code and countless others.
0	There's craft, care and sensitivity in every frame of Labor Day, so why does the movie feel so counterfeit? It's a puzzle.
0	Another genre exercise for Soderbergh that he has managed to pull off with the help of his Hollywood friends to entertaining, if ultimately rather underwhelming, effect.
0	Honestly, I had a decent time.
0	Despite some rather surprisingly good acting by some of the most unlikely of cast members, the film's directing and editing style ultimately ruin Alpha Dog.
0	Despite fleeting moments of entertainment, The Angry Birds Movie comes across as a hollow viewing experience that doesn't have much to offer - even for kids.
0	A charming film, with dialogues and convincing situations and with two protagonists who know how to convey the feelings of the beginning in a love story. [Full review in Spanish]
0	What keeps this from being one more soap opera is the superb acting of Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk.
0	Reeder didn't make a film, but a fireworks display. Bursts of style and emotion streak across a cold, dark backdrop of mortality.
0	In all, American girls could do worse than have Blue Crush as their own summer action movie.
0	London Has Fallen is simply the latest in the tradition of "Die Hard in a..." films. In this instance, it's Die Hard set in London. And that's it. The film doesn't have much else.
0	It's admittedly better than some of Allen's DOA comedies of the past decade. To think that his weak attempt at a morality play represents some return to form, however, is a pipe dream.
0	Even if you enjoy rom-coms, you'll be struggling to find more than two mild chuckles in this waste of time and celluloid.
0	The evidence suggests director Tom Green is more a fan of Kathryn Bigelow and Terrence Malick than of Ray Harryhausen; that's not a bad thing, unless your Bigelow-influenced monster movie is pretentious and dreary.
0	Tthe detail of the animation is as exceptional as ever, from Barley's beard fluff and the fraying cut-off sleeves of his denim waistcoat to the dull gleam of petrol-station neon in the oily, rain-soaked tarmac.
0	Despite Headshot's flaws, it does have a mesmerizing quality in its illustration of humanity's dark side, social and spiritual. It's a film that coaxes into its world rather than drags.
0	From start to almost finish, "Man Up", directed by Ben Palmer from a terrific script by Tess Morris, sustains a remarkably high level of verbal invention.
0	Sure, a new bar in computer animation is set, but if this is what the movies of tomorrow are going to be like, I'll stick with yesterday.
0	Katrina is gorgeous and Akshay Kumar strains every muscle in his body to make you laugh. But the lazy writing does them in.
0	People have always been, and always will be, impressed with big movies; this Western was one of the very biggest.
0	In its mood and methods, "A Ciambra" pays homage to the work of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the living masters of European realist cinema.
0	Todd Haynes thinks that he pays homage to Sirk when he's really just making the subtle more obvious. Far From Heaven really needs a shot of modern deconstruction to be worth anything.
0	Long spans of time pass between lines of dialogue, many of which seem to have been inexpertly translated from a foreign language so that they almost make sense but not quite.
0	Despite the comedy's reliance on drug humor, first-time director Jesse Dylan is actually less interested in getting high than in seeing how low he can go.
0	The Ringer is often predictable, frequently offensive and occasionally boring, but its heart is in exactly the right place.
0	You get more of the same Butler with Hunter Killeras the film that takes us to the bottom of the ocean with it.
0	A distinctly shameless and shoddily made family comedy, this WWE production for wrestler Big Show turns an already saccharine plot into a toxic, fart-laden piledriver.
0	A series far from its Prime
0	The stylish film is deliberately paced yet rewards patience with some clever and deeply felt twists to keep moviegoers guessing.
0	The movie is bad enough to make David Mamet, who wrote the razor-sharp play that inspired the original movie, roll over in his piles of money.
0	Southbound strives for unity and mostly succeeds.
0	The grand finale of Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings trilogy meets the high expectations set up by its two predecessors.
0	Pryor appears to self-delete expletives in Brewster's Millions by making a litany of far more offensive Stepin Fetchit facial expressions.
0	Hardly any shattering revelations here and certainly no blame-placing.
0	Wanders around in a state of creative lassitude and finally collapses in an ending that smells suspiciously of market-testing.
0	One dalmatian too many.
0	Color Out of Space feels painfully long and, even more so than Mom & Dad, it loses more than it gains from Nic Cage's unintentionally campy performance. The result is a film that feels like a torturous slog.
0	Zwick (Courage Under Fire) has fashioned another ethical tour de force that reveals his dedication to serious filmmaking.
0	Calling this film a cat-and-mouse game would insult felines and rodents, both of which are much smarter than this movie.
0	You should always be suspicious of homeless dramas that star Oscar-nominated Hollywood actors.
0	As contrived and plot-hole ridden as it is, F/X still works quite effectively as a crowd-pleasing popcorn picture.
0	(Aaliyah) absolutely transcends the screen and fills the whole theater with her presence...she dominates this incongruous vampire flick with her chilling allure.
0	Take away the Guggenheim shootout and we've at least got Clive Owen at half throttle. Take away Owen and there's nothing left but the tired old mystic cabal of sadistic sorcerers.
0	With his slicked-up quiff, turned-up jeans and revved-up attitude, Dean instantly achieved icon status.
0	The film interprets itself, offering an essay on rape and gender fluidity that locks us out of the cognitive process of digesting it.
0	The momentum from the movie's first half dwindles to nothing.
0	Ratatouille is a wonderful, wistful comedy, and a sparkling return to form for the computer animation studio Pixar after last year's lacklustre Cars.
0	It's gritty and grimy, but surprisingly funny too, and cinematography superstar Ari Wegner does an excellent job in providing a real sense of the unforgiving landscape.
0	Leap! tends to be thoughtless, pandering and rife with historical lapses.
0	A bona fide cult object in the making.
0	Miss Sloane is a taut "thriller", for lack of a better genre pigeonhole, brilliantly acted and intriguingly constructed, with only several baffling creative decisions bringing it slightly down.
0	Although the filmmaker often puts specifically Christian imagery into his film, his sensibility turns out to be more Zen: he can find manifestations of glory in both the noblest gesture and the darkest impulse.
0	On paper, it must have seemed like a solid idea
0	It felt like a Lifetime movie.
0	A forever young, forever fresh family film. One of the best.
0	While a welcome respite from the obnoxiousness of The Waterboy and Big Daddy, this sedate, reasonable Sandler is likely to frustrate his fans as much as did his dramatic turn in Punch-Drunk Love.
0	Although some may find the ping-pong time travels as distracting or even annoying, this is definitely my pick as the most beauteous and emotionally exquisite films of the decade. The Fountain speaks volumes.
0	With lackluster effects and no atmosphere, this is a horror that horrifies in the wrong way.
0	The two actors generate a decent chemistry together and manage to give this cobbled-together stinker whatever tiny shred of credibility it possesses as a romance.
0	It's a slow, painterly movie with sudden, sustained outbursts of violence.
0	'Loving Pablo' wants to address too much and fails to hit any of the aspects about Pablo Escobar's life. [Full Review in Spanish]
0	Preposterous, pretentious.
0	... it's too cutesy by half, and not nearly scathing enough in its indictment of our current electoral system.
0	Once again, Almodovar changes directions and this time delivers a thematic treatise on the Catholic church wrapped up in a mystery.
0	Do you believe that children deserve something better than empty-calorie candy floss? Clap your hands if you do.
0	[An] enjoyable if simplistic black comedy loosely based on a novel by Larry Beinhart.
0	Folks, Orwell probably is rolling in his grave, not because 1984 has come to be, but because his name is attached to such a lousy movie.
0	An irrepressible pioneer of BASE jumping contributes greatly to his own encomium in Sunshine Superman, Marah Strauch's very fine look at the legacy of Carl Boenish.
0	As momentarily enticing and as intellectually deficient as a box of Timbits.
0	A film that defies stereotypes and in a timely manner given the nativist wall Trump intends to build. The wild horses that the Wolves support have much in common with the animals that are threatened by the wall--as well as people fleeing drug gangs.
0	Second breath, inexorable suffocation
0	Tells a thin and wispy story about shallow, underdeveloped characters about whom I had a lot of trouble caring.
0	With hyper-active editing and camerawork that doesn't stay still for longer than a second at a time, Mulberry Street is too frenetic to always be comprehensible.
0	An extremely funny movie.
0	Phantasm: Ravager is not the place to start with the series (noobs beware), but it's a helluva way to end it.
0	Tom Ford's second feature, Nocturnal Animals, is a movie within a movie, and while both are lushly attractive, full of precise light and deep reds, neither is very good.
0	From the corny 'see what we did there?' title to a plot that's as predictable as a transatlantic flight-path, this is a truly join-the-dots romcom.
0	The plot's eventual denigration of the single life and endorsement of soul mates and happily-ever-afters is predictably rote.
0	The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies feels more like a film made for those with a deep, vested interest in arguing about what was left out from the book, or what was added in and shouldn't have been.
0	"Something Borrowed" asks the question, "Is it possible to pull off a romantic comedy in which you don't want anyone to end up with anyone else?" The answer is, "No."
0	Dirty Girl isn't. Sorry, but it's just faux grime, a thin layer of bad behaviour that wipes clean with a two-ply tissue to reveal the real movie beneath - all shiny sentimentality.
0	Platt is a good comic actor and I have liked him in a lot of movies, but here he is not well-used.
0	A tepid rehash.
0	Brings with it a very relevant and important moral that bears pondering by fans.
0	...features an alarming number of classy actors getting whacked in the most ghastly and classless of ways.
0	It doesn't amount to a whole lot, but it's frequently moving and reasonably well made.
0	To the extent that "Becoming" has something to sell, and it does, it's not the subject so much as what she stands for.
0	packs in virtually every horror-movie paradigm from the last 30 years into a lean 90 minutes
0	Terminator Salvation is so programmed, so impersonal, that it practically dares you to warm to its characters.
0	Very silly.
0	Coppola's recent viewing seems to have been German silent films of the '20s, so he has decided to coat the whole enterprise in a startling Expressionist style, which is very arresting but hardly appropriate to the matter in hand.
0	Dysfunctional-family mysteries are unearthed in this delicately rendered but rather pallid adaptation of a novel.
0	The movie ultimately gets more right than wrong, finding the proper balance between spectacle and storytelling.
0	A layer of special effects, impressively done on low budget, and vague ideas about military control and corporate greed, camouflage a naive, simplistic tale about fathers and sons and attachment to the land.
0	There's not a single redeeming feature in this colossal over-budgeted waste of time...
0	Radiates warmth and energy from fun, kind people sharing love for each other and playing music together.
